# Yoga Pose Detection

# Description
 Yoga Pose Detection is a real-time computer vision project that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect and identify various yoga poses. By leveraging the capabilities of MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries, this project offers a seamless solution for visualizing and analyzing yoga poses through live video input.

# Features
 - Real-time Pose Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track yoga poses in real-time.
 - Predefined Poses: Comes with a predefined set of common yoga poses for accurate detection and comparison.
 - Overlay Visualization: Provides visual feedback by overlaying detected poses on the live video stream.
 - Pose Validation: Validates detected poses against predefined templates, highlighting correct and incorrect poses.
 - Customization: Allows users to customize the predefined poses and overlay styles to suit their preferences.

 Installation
 1. Clone the repository:
