# Yoga Pose Detection

# Description:
 This project aims to detect yoga poses in real-time using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It utilizes machine learning models to recognize predefined yoga poses and overlays them on live video input.

 Features:
 - Real-time yoga pose detection using MediaPipe.
 - Predefined poses for comparison.
 - Green overlay for correct poses, red overlay for incorrect ones.
 - Utilizes OpenCV for video input and overlay.

# Installation:
 1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yoga-pose-detection.git
     ```
# 2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd yoga-pose-detection
     ```
 3. Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python mediapipe
     ```

# Usage:
 1. Run the `yoga.py` script:
     ```bash
     python yoga.py
     ```
 2. Open the webcam to visualize the real-time pose detection.
 3. Perform yoga poses in front of the camera to see the detection overlay.
 4. Exit the program by pressing `Esc`.

# Customization:
 - You can modify the predefined yoga poses and their corresponding landmarks in the `yoga.py` script.
 - Adjust the colors and styles of the overlay in the `yoga.py` script.
